Overview
Project Topic
This project focuses on checking about Security Posture and Risk Assessment on how secure IT systems are and find ways to make them safer. The goal is to look at risks, identify weaknesses and provide recommendations and suggest improvements to protect against threats.
Project, Aim
We want to help an organization understand its security risks and improve its protection against threats. By doing a risk assessment, we will highlight problem areas and suggest ways to fix them.
Problem Statement 
Companies face increasing risks from cyber threats like hacking, malware, and data leaks. Many of the companies don’t have clear strategy to deal with these issues. This project will analyse or examine their security, identify weak spots, and suggest solutions to make their systems safer.
In Scope
•	We will review the company’s IT security setup to understand how well it protects against cyber threats.
•	We will identify risks, weaknesses, and areas that need improvement.
•	We will examine the company's security policies and how well they follow industry standards.
•	We will suggest practical steps to strengthen security and reduce risks.
•	We will create a detailed risk assessment report with all our findings and recommendations.
Out of Scope
•	We won’t make any security changes or fixes ourselves.
•	We won’t perform hacking, penetration testing, or any hands-on security testing.
•	We won’t look at physical security risks, such as building access or surveillance systems.
Who Will Benefit 
This project is useful for companies and organisations that want to improve their cybersecurity. The findings from our final report will help the company to make their systems safer and protect against cyber threats.
